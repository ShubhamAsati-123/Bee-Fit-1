Eating eggs improves your reflexes !!
If you want to be able to respond more quickly, you can start by having an omelette for breakfast.
Eggs contain an amino acid called tyrosine, which the body synthesizes into norepinephrine and dopamine, compounds that increase energy and alertness and improve mood.
In a 2014 study published in the journal Neuropsychologia, researchers even found that tyrosine enhances our response time and improves our intellectual performance, not unlike a medical stimulant like Ritalin or Modafinil.
